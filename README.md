# RoboLDA
This is the repository of paper "RoboLDA: Probabilistic Model for Uncovering the Embodied Hierarchical Structure of Robot Morphology". 

Please properly install the simulation environment EvoGym by following the instructions at https://evolutiongym.github.io/, and then place the folders in this repository under "/examples". 

Our main program is in `RoboLDA.py` and the code for robot control with organ synergy is `run_metamorph_organ.py`.
